# Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1
This repository contains the work I did for the [algorithms course on Coursera written by Tim Roughgarden](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithm-design-analysis). I've seen many of these algorithms before in classes I took at school, but I decided to take this course as a refresher and to ensure I have a good grasp of several of the fundamental algorithms in Computer Science.
